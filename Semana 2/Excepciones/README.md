# Exceptions

_During the execution of a program, several conditions can occur that cause an unexpected and abnormal termination of the program as in the example:_

_In Java, errors that occur at runtime are represented by exceptions. Java provides a predefined set of exceptions that can be used during program execution._

_To avoid unexpected program termination, Java allows us to handle exceptions using appropriate constructs._

_Exceptions and errors are represented through Java classes and organized in a hierarchy._

_The Throwable class is the superclass of all error and exception types. _

_Errors represent events that the programmer cannot control (for example, OutOfMemoryError ), while Exceptions can be handled during program execution._

### java.lang.Launchable
- Throwable is the root class for errors and exceptions
- It is super class for subclasses, ie; exception and error.

### java.lang.Exception
- java.lang.Exception is a superclass for all exception types
- Extends the java.lang.Throwable class
- Exceptions are classified into checked exception and unchecked exception

### java.lang.Error:
- java.lang.Error is a superclass for all error types
- Extends the java.lang.Throwable class
- Errors are due to lack of system resources and is not recoverable
- All errors fall into the category of unchecked , since it is generated due to lack of system resources at runtime.
- It is outside the scope of programming, since it is not predicted.

## MISTAKE

_An error is a subclass of the **java.lang.Error** class. The error indicates a serious problem that cannot be handled through code._

_For example, *OutOfMemoryError* occurs when the Java heap space is full, *StackOverflowError* is another error that is generated by the JVM when the required stack for the program is larger than the memory allocated by the JRE._

The above code eventually throws *StackOverFlowError* since the test() method is executed an infinite number of times.
 

## EXCEPTIONS

### Unchecked

_It is a subclass of the **java.lang.RunTimeException** class. The runtime exception usually occurs due to bad programming or a programming error._

_Since unchecked exceptions occur at runtime, we don't need to throw the exception in the method signature, although we can, but it's not required._

_For example, *NullPointerExecption* is a type of RunTimeException that occurs when a variable is not assigned an object and still points to null._

### Checked

_Is the exception that will be checked at compile time, if a method throws a checked exception._

_For example: *FileNotFoundException*_

## Catching exceptions

_In Java, to catch the exceptions that may have been produced, we use the expressions **"try"** and **"catch"** to delimit the code that we want to control. When an exception occurs, "try" terminates and "catch" receives the Throwable object as an argument. _
